hiiiiiiii!!!!!!!
the folder contains 3 themes for aseprite!
if you're not sure how to download/apply the themes, look at a tutorial online!

the following themes are:
*default (green)
*dark and mysterious (blue)
*pretty in pink (pink)

i hope you like my themes!

also, if you're going to modify/recolor my theme, maybe credit me? not like i own this theme though, as most were just a plain old recolor of the default aseprite theme.

anyways, smell ya later! -cz43
